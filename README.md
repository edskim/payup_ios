#PayUp

Simple and silly app made using Twilio.

Add people who owe you money. When the contact is selected, a call is sent to them with an automated voice that states:

"\<name\>, you owe \<requester\> \<amount\> dollars. Pay this amount in full by \<date\>, or else."


You must supply an AuthToken.h that defines AUTH_TOKEN as your twilio auth token string.
